step 1 :
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv EA312927

step 2 :
echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/3.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.2.list

step 3 :
sudo apt-get update

step 4:
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org

to use mongodb , we need to use mongoose in node just by adding it to package.json of our project & running npm install.

To start with
> sudo service mongod start

once it is started , use > mongo

MongoDB is a cross-platform, document oriented database that provides, high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. MongoDB works on concept of collection and document.
Database

Database is a physical container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases.
Collection

Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enforce a schema. Documents within a collection can have different fields. Typically, all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose.


Sample Document

{
   _id: ObjectId(7df78ad8902c)
   title: 'MongoDB Overview', 
   description: 'MongoDB is no sql database',
   by: 'tutorials point',
   url: 'http://www.tutorialspoint.com',
   tags: ['mongodb', 'database', 'NoSQL'],

      {
         user:'user1',
         message: 'My first comment',
         dateCreated: new Date(2011,1,20,2,15),
         like: 0 
      },
      {
         user:'user2',
         message: 'My second comments',
         dateCreated: new Date(2011,1,25,7,45),
         like: 5
      }
   ]
}

_id is a 12 bytes hexadecimal number which assures the uniqueness of every document. You can provide _id while inserting the document. If you don’t provide then MongoDB provides a unique id for every document. These 12 bytes first 4 bytes for the current timestamp, next 3 bytes for machine id, next 2 bytes for process id of MongoDB server and remaining 3 bytes are simple incremental VALUE.

Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS

    Schema less − MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the    document can differ from one document to another.

    Structure of a single object is clear.

    No complex joins.

    Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.

    Tuning.

    Ease of scale-out − MongoDB is easy to scale.

    Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed.

    Uses internal memory for storing the (windowed) working set, enabling faster access of data.
